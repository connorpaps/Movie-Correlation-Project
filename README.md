# Movie-Correlation-Project

A data analysis of the movie dataset downloaded from Kaggle in Python with readable code results using Jupyter Notebook.

The goal was to attempt to find correlations between the gross revenue of a movie and other data variables such as budget and the company of the movie.
Initial Hypothesis:
- Budget and Gross Earnings potentially related (more money spent = higher quality movie = more gross revenue)
- Company and Gross Earnings potentially related (More popular/larger companies may have bigger budgets/brand recognition = more gross revenue)

Tasks Performed:
- Reading the dataset
- Cleaning the dataset
- Sorting the dataset
- Correlation Analysis (Scatter plot, regression plot, correlation matrix)
- Summary of Findings

Findings Summary
Initial Hypothesis Results
- Budget was confirmed to have a positive correlation to gross earnings
- Company did not have any positive correlation to gross earnings

Newly Discovered Correlations
- Votes also had a postiive correlation to gross earnings (more votes = more popular/viewed more = more gross revenue earned)
